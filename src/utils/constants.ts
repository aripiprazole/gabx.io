  'software engineer with a passion for functional programming ' +
  'and the Kotlin programming language. In my free time, I enjoy ' +
  'playing Minecraft and working on projects related to compilers. ' +
  'I am excited to share my skills and experience with others in the field.';

export const ABOUT_WORK =
  'I specialize in web site and ' +
  'working with the Minecraft protocol. With years of experience ' +
  'in software development, I have a passion for creating efficient ' +

export const ABOUT_PROJECTS =
  "I'm passionate about compilers, type " +
  'theory, the Minecraft protocol, and Hindley Milner! These topics ' +
  'perfectly blend my love for programming and problem-solving. Compilers ' +
  'transform code into machine code, while Hindley Milner adds elegance ' +
  'and safety to the process. Tinkering with the Minecraft protocol to ' +
  'optimize and customize gameplay is a joy. I love pushing the boundaries ' +
  'of programming and seeking new challenges!';
